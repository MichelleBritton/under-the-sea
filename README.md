# Portfolio Project 2 - Under the Sea Memory Game

The Under the Sea Memory Game is an interactive game for two players. The purpose of the game is to beat your opponent by matching the most pairs of cards. The game is targeted towards young children, as it is simple to follow and encourages them to use their memory to win, although can be enjoyed by people of any age! 

It has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and is responsively designed allowing users to play it on a range of devices.

## Features
### Existing Features
#### Heading
The heading is located centrally at the top of the page using a large font with a text shadow so that it stands out from the background image enabling the user to see the name of the game easily.

#### Welcome Panel 
The welcome panel is the initial screen that you see when you visit the site. It contains information explaining the aim of the game, how to play the game and how to get started. To start playing the game, it requires the two players to enter their names into the input boxes and click on the "Start" button. If they do not complete both boxes, an alert will appear asking them to fill in both fields. Once the button is clicked, the welcome panel will fade out and the grid of cards will appear.
